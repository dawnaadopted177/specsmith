"""Belief Artifact model — core AEE primitive.

A BeliefArtifact is a codable, testable, deployable unit of knowledge.
In specsmith, requirements, architectural decisions, and constraints are all
modelled as BeliefArtifacts — claims about what the system does, should do,
or must not do, each with an explicit epistemic boundary (the assumptions and
context within which the claim must hold) and a confidence level.

Theoretical basis
-----------------
Applied Epistemic Engineering (AEE) treats belief systems like code:
codable, testable, and deployable. The five foundational axioms are:

  1. Observability   — Every belief must be inspectable. Hidden assumptions
                       are a stop condition (Hard Rule H13).
  2. Falsifiability  — Every belief must be challengeable. A claim that cannot
                       be challenged is not an engineering artifact; it is dogma.
  3. Irreducibility  — Beliefs must be decomposed to their primitive propositions.
                       Compound beliefs that cannot be reduced often hide Logic Knots.
  4. Reconstructability — After stress-testing, every failed belief must yield a
                         reconstructed belief that satisfies Observability and
                         Falsifiability. Recovery is always possible; it may require
                         modifying the scope, not just the claim.
  5. Convergence     — Systematic application of the Stress-Test (S) and Recovery (R)
                       operators always converges to an Equilibrium Point E where
                       S(G) yields no new failure modes.

    Fields
    ------
    artifact_id : str
        Unique identifier (e.g. "REQ-CLI-001", "DEC-001", "ARCH-BE-001").
    propositions : list[str]
        Atomic, independently testable claims that compose this belief.
        Each proposition must satisfy Observability (inspectable) and
        Falsifiability (challengeable). Compound claims should be split.
    epistemic_boundary : list[str]
        The assumptions and context within which all propositions must hold.
        This is the Δ in AEE notation. Explicit boundaries prevent hidden
        assumptions (which violate H13 — Epistemic Boundaries Required).
    inferential_links : list[str]
        IDs of BeliefArtifacts this artifact logically depends on or derives
        from. Used by FailureModeGraph to detect Logic Knots and by
        CertaintyEngine to propagate confidence.
    confidence : ConfidenceLevel
        Current epistemic confidence (UNKNOWN → LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH).
    status : BeliefStatus
        Lifecycle status.
    failure_modes : list[FailureMode]
        Failure modes discovered during stress-testing. Empty until
        StressTester has been applied.
    source_text : str
        The original requirement or decision text this was parsed from.
    component : str
        The component code (e.g. "CLI", "AEE", "TRC") from the REQ ID.
    priority : str
        Priority from the source document (P1, P2, P3, or empty).
